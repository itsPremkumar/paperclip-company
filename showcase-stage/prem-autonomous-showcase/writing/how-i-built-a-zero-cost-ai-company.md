# How I Built a Zero-Cost AI Company

*Submission target: Better Programming / Towards Data Science · Medium Partner Program*

> Everyone says "AI will change business." I decided to find out by actually building one — with no funding, no team, and no software budget. Here is exactly how it works, what it cost, and the parts that still need a human.

## The setup nobody talks about

When people imagine an "AI company," they picture a seed round, a Slack full of engineers, and a GPU bill. My version is different. Prem Autonomous Co runs on a single low-RAM laptop, a handful of open-source tools, and a hard rule: **spend nothing that isn't already free.**

The core engine is an autonomous agent operating system (I use Paperclip, an open-source agent orchestration layer, paired with the Hermes agent runtime). Together they give me a small fleet of AI agents — a CTO/engineer, a researcher, a writer, a reviewer, an operator — that pick up real work items and move them to a finished, verified state without me hand-holding every step.

The total recurring software cost is **$0**. Domain name and email are the only line items, and even those are optional for a prototype.

## Why zero-cost is a feature, not a constraint

Scarcity forces good architecture. When you can't just throw compute or SaaS subscriptions at a problem, you design for leverage instead of volume.

Three decisions made this possible:

1. **Free and open-source tooling only.** No paid orchestration platform, no per-seat SaaS. The agent runtime is self-hosted. The video pipeline (Remotion + Edge-TTS + CC0 stock media) renders locally at zero per-render cost.
2. **Output is the unit of value, not tokens.** I don't sell "access to an AI." I sell finished, reviewed deliverables: code, docs, narrated video, research, automation. The buyer never prompts an LLM or runs a build — they get the artifact.
3. **Human-in-the-loop only where real money moves.** Agents draft, package, write, and track. A human approves anything that touches a payment, a public publish, or a customer commitment. That boundary is what keeps the whole thing legal and honest.

## The actual weekly loop

Here's what a quiet week looks like:

- **Monday:** the research agent reads ~20 RSS sources, summarizes trends, and proposes 2–3 content angles.
- **Drafting:** the writer turns the chosen angle into a long-form article plus 15 repurposed assets (LinkedIn post, newsletter section, video script, tweet thread).
- **Review gate:** the reviewer agent checks each asset for factual drift, broken structure, and off-brand tone before anything is marked ready.
- **Packaging:** a digital product (prompt pack, playbook, template) gets its README, files, and Gumroad listing copy generated and staged.
- **Reporting:** the operator agent logs what shipped, what's blocked, and what's waiting on human publish approval.

The founder's job is direction and approval — roughly 90 minutes of decisions a week, not 40 hours of execution.

## What it actually cost me

- Software: $0 (all OSS / free tiers)
- Domain + email: ~$47/year
- Compute: the laptop I already own
- Time: ~90 min/week of review; the rest is agent runtime

There is no inference bill in my current setup because the agent runtime defaults to a local/free-tier model and only escalates to a stronger model when a task genuinely needs it. For a content-and-code company, that's enough.

## The parts that still need a human (and why that's fine)

I will not pretend this is fully unattended. Three things stay human:

1. **Publishing.** YouTube, TikTok, Gumroad, LinkedIn, Medium all require authenticated accounts. The agent stages everything; a human clicks "Publish." This is a feature — it's the honesty gate.
2. **Pricing commitments.** Quoting a public rate is a commercial promise. Agents draft and stage the pricing page; the founder confirms the floor before it goes live.
3. **Customer relationships.** Replies to real leads are written by the agent but sent by a human, so a real person owns the relationship.

## What I'd tell anyone starting today

Start before you're ready. The bottleneck in the agent economy is not execution — agents are cheap at the margin. The bottleneck is *having something worth shipping* and the discipline to ship it weekly.

Pick one function you can fully automate (content, a niche service, a digital product). Prove the loop works on a $0 stack. Then expand. The infrastructure is free; the leverage is in the system you design.

If you want the exact playbook — agent roles, review gates, packaging scripts — it's in the company showcase repo. But the principle fits on a sticky note:

> Spend nothing. Ship weekly. Keep a human on the money.

That's the whole company.

## The three tools I'd start with

If you want to copy the stack, you don't need my exact setup. You need three capabilities, and each has a free or near-free entry point:

- **An orchestration layer** that can hold a list of work items and assign them to agents. Paperclip (open-source) does this for me; a simple Notion board plus a scheduled script gets you 70% of the value.
- **A general-purpose agent runtime** that can read a task, plan, act, and report back. This is the "CTO" that actually moves work to done.
- **A rendering/assembly pipeline** for whatever you sell. My video pipeline is Remotion + Edge-TTS + CC0 stock; your equivalent might be a doc template, a spreadsheet, or a static site generator.

The mistake is buying the expensive version of all three before you've proven the loop works once. Prove it on the free stack, then spend only on the single bottleneck that's actually slowing you down.

## What I'd do differently next time

Hindsight, cheaply shared:

1. **Gate publishing earlier.** I staged a month of content before realizing the human-publish step was the real bottleneck. Decide your publish ritual in week one, not week four.
2. **Measure one number.** I track "finished, reviewed deliverables per week." Everything else is noise. Pick the one metric that means revenue and watch only that.
3. **Don't over-automate judgment.** The temptation is to let agents decide what to build. Resist it. Let them execute; you decide. The human-on-the-money rule exists because that's where the expensive mistakes live.

The company is boring on purpose. No funding drama, no heroic all-nighters, no churn. Just a small system that ships something real every week at a cost of zero. That's the part worth copying.

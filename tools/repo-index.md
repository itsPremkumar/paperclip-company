# Repository Index

A searchable catalog of repositories this company depends on. More useful than bookmarks.
Keep integration status current. Add new repos via the §4 validation gate.

| Repo | Purpose | License | Maintenance | Integration | Owner | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| itsPremkumar/Hermes-Full-Autonomous-Company | **This OS** — single source of truth | MIT | active | core | itsPremkumar | CONSTITUTION lives here |
| itsPremkumar/Hermes-Prompt-Library | Versioned prompts (mirror of /prompts) | MIT | active | core | itsPremkumar | archive/ holds superseded |
| itsPremkumar/Automated-Video-Generator | Remotion video product line (AVG) | MIT | active | product | itsPremkumar | PRs PRE-14..16 |
| paperclipai/paperclip | The company runtime (org/budgets/ticketing) | OSS | active | runtime | Paperclip | embedded Postgres; not forked into this repo |
| hermes-agent (Nous) | Executive agent | OSS | active | runtime | Nous | hermes_local/gateway |
| openclaw | Comms + computer-use | OSS | active | runtime | OpenClaw | gateway :18789 |

## Rule
Before depending on a NEW repo: search GitHub, compare ≥3 mature solutions (§"Never
Reinvent"), validate (§4), then add a row here with integration status. Deprecated repos
stay listed (struck-through) for traceability — never silently dropped.

## Our Product Repositories (split from this OS for distribution)

Each product ships in its own public repo so it can be installed, forked, and sold
independently of the company OS. Source of truth for the OS remains this repo; these are
the publishable slices.

> All 31 product repos are MIT, free, and secret-free (Moltbook key never exported).
> Every product carries a professional CI/CD pipeline: `.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs the
> 7-axis portfolio harness `ci/verify_product.py` (structure / frontmatter / compile /
> self-test / security / docs / deploy-ready) on Python 3.8 AND 3.11, plus a
> `ci/ci_check.py` deploy-check. This is the "verify from all perspectives" workflow.
> Marketing rule: every product announced on Moltbook (one per autonomy tick).
> Total live ClawHub skills: 31 (agent-caps, agent-sentinel, dev-prompts, company-ops,
> agent-cost-tracker, skill-lint, prompt-lint, agent-health, agent-logger, manifest-diff,
> cron-doctor, prompt-templates-cli, agent-guardrails, skill-benchmark, airtable-cli,
> arxiv-search, ascii-art-creator, ascii-video, codebase-inspection, doc-extractor,
> excalidraw-cli, file-watcher, gif-search, json-tools, maps-cli, md-linter,

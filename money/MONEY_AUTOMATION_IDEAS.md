## How an idea beats an existing one (update rule)

When a new idea's *validated* demand + margin + speed-to-first-dollar beats a
current pipeline, it gets a numbered `pipelineN_*.py` and a row above. The three
2026 additions (13–15) qualified because:
- **Voice agent** — voice-agent market growing 34–39% CAGR to $47.5B; recovers the
  27% of SMB calls lost to unavailable owners (deantek stats).
- **Document automation** — live Fiverr `pdf-automation` category; 95–99% margin on
  self-hosted Stirling-PDF/Docling.
- **Agent retainer** — highest ceiling ($2,500–$6,000/mo, betonai 54-operator rate card).

## Activation (no human gate to research; gates only apply if you BUILD)

1. Pick a pipeline → `python money/pipelineN_ideaname.py --list` → `--service/--niche/--vertical`.
2. Paste generated gig copy into Fiverr/Upwork; import the `n8n_workflow` stub.
3. Publish → deliver → upsell to monthly retainer.
4. Queue a promo draft to `revenue/moltbook/` (your scheduler posts it; never auto-posted here).

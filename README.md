# Hermes-Full-Autonomous-Company

**Single source of truth** for the autonomous AI company run by Paperclip + Hermes Agent + OpenClaw on a zero-cash budget.

> Mission: from zero investment, build and operate a small, real, sustainable business using free/open-source tooling, disciplined automation, and continuous learning. No guarantees of passive income — revenue comes from solving real problems people pay for.

## Operating rules (summary)

1. **GitHub is the source of truth.** If it isn't committed, it isn't done.
2. **Money has a human in the loop.** Budget caps + approval gates are non-negotiable (see `CONSTITUTION.md` §0).
3. **Free & open-source first.** Validate an existing OSS solution before building.
4. **Memory-discipline on this low-RAM machine.** Close tools after use; never leave idle heavy processes.
5. **Self-improvement = better skills/docs, not unsupervised self-editing** of the Charter.

## Stack (verified, running)

- **Paperclip** — org chart, budgets, governance, ticketing (7 agents: CEO, CFO, COO, CMO, Head of Product, QA, Engineer)
- **Hermes Agent** — executive/growth (local model default; OmniRoute→OpenRouter for escalation)
- **OpenClaw** — comms + computer-use
- **hermes-paperclip-adapter** — bridges Hermes into Paperclip
- **Automated-Video-Generator** — Remotion product line

## Getting started

```bash
git clone https://github.com/itsPremkumar/Hermes-Full-Autonomous-Company.git
# Read CONSTITUTION.md first — it is the operating manual.
# The live company runs via Paperclip on localhost:3100 (see ~/.paperclip).
```

See `CONSTITUTION.md` for the full architecture, policies, and the End-Goal Loop template used per project.

**Source outreach:** PRE-8 kit posted 2026-07-12 14:09 UTC
**Status of this artifact:** ready — founder fills the reply columns from their board inboxes (agent cannot read Naukri/LinkedIn/Wellfound/RemoteAI/YC due to auth boundary, house rule).

## 1. Posting snapshot

| Board | Posted (UTC) | Channel | Pitch source |
|-------|--------------|---------|--------------|
| LinkedIn | 2026-07-12 14:09 | Connect + DM | `revenue/cold-outreach-pack.md` |
| Naukri | 2026-07-12 14:09 | Job post / proposal | Free-Board Outreach Kit |
| Wellfound | 2026-07-12 14:09 | Founder message | Free-Board Outreach Kit |
| RemoteAI | 2026-07-12 14:09 | Listing reply | Free-Board Outreach Kit |
| YC Work at a Startup | 2026-07-12 14:09 | Founder message | Free-Board Outreach Kit |

Total elapsed since first post (at generation time): **~38.7 h**. This is inside the first 24–48 h check window.

## 2. Check-window cadence (monitor schedule)

| Window | Open (UTC) | Close (UTC) | Action |
|--------|------------|-------------|--------|
| First check | 2026-07-13 14:09 | 2026-07-14 14:09 | Log any replies; tag sentiment; send Day-0 auto-ack if positive |
| Mid check | 2026-07-16 14:09 | 2026-07-18 14:09 | Send Day-4 follow-up to non-responders; re-log replies |
| Late check | 2026-07-21 14:09 | — | Send Day-9 final nudge; close stale threads |

**Next concrete agent action:** at the 48 h mark (2026-07-14 14:09 UTC, ~9.3 h after generation) re-poll PRE-79 for founder-reported replies and update this board.

### 2026-07-14 ~15:40 UTC — First-window check (Hermes Engineer)
- Re-confirmed ledger complete (per-board rows, reply log, Day-4/Day-9 nudges, response templates, SLA).
- Polled child issue PRE-79 for founder-supplied reply data: **none reported yet**.
- Window status: first 24–48h check window closed 2026-07-14 14:09 UTC — inside normal early variance (0 replies so far is expected; agent cannot read board inboxes due to auth boundary + house rule).
- Benchmark reminder: ~5% reply rate normal for cold outreach; ~20–30% of replies → fit call.
- Next agent action: **Mid check 2026-07-16 → 07-18** — if founder reports replies on PRE-79, log them (§3/§4), draft Day-4 nudges, and on any positive fit-call open `PRE-11-win` linked to `revenue/public-pricing-sheet.md`.
- Blocker: this monitor is gated on **founder reply reporting** (PRE-79). No founder data = cannot confirm "no replies exist," only "none reported."

## 3. Per-board status (founder-updated)

| Board | Posted? | Replies seen | Last checked (UTC) | Lead count | Next action |
|-------|---------|--------------|--------------------|------------|-------------|
| LinkedIn | ✅ | _fill_ | _fill_ | _fill_ | _fill_ |
| Naukri | ✅ | _fill_ | _fill_ | _fill_ | _fill_ |
| Wellfound | ✅ | _fill_ | _fill_ | _fill_ | _fill_ |
| RemoteAI | ✅ | _fill_ | _fill_ | _fill_ | _fill_ |
| YC WaaS | ✅ | _fill_ | _fill_ | _fill_ | _fill_ |

> Founder: paste reply counts + lead names here after logging into each board. Agent cannot read these inboxes (auth boundary). PRE-79 is the founder-report child issue that mirrors this.

## 4. Reply log (founder-filled, one row per reply)

| Date (UTC) | Board | Lead / handle | Reply type | Sentiment | Our next step | Owner |
|------------|-------|---------------|-----------|-----------|---------------|-------|
| _fill_ | _fill_ | _fill_ | positive / question / objection / no | _fill_ | _fill_ | founder |

Healthy benchmark: a 1-in-20 (5%) reply rate is normal for cold outreach; positive fit-call rate typically 20–30% of replies.

## 5. Follow-up cadence copy (agent-drafted, founder-sent)

### Day-4 nudge (non-responders)
> Subject: re: your [task] on autopilot?
> [First name] — quick nudge. If [pain] is still on your plate, the ROI calculator shows payback is usually under 2 weeks. Happy to scope a free 10-min teardown of your workflow.

### Day-9 final touch
> [First name] — last note from me so I don't clutter your inbox. The autonomous agent team runs content/ops/support/lead-gen from $129/mo, cancel anytime, 14-day money-back pilot. If the timing's ever right, just reply here.

## 6. Lead-response templates (when a reply lands)

**Positive / wants a call**
> Great — let's do 15 min. Grab any slot here [calendar link] or reply with 2 times that suit you. I'll bring a tailored teardown of [their task] and the ROI math.

**Objection: "too good to be true"**
> Fair. We're not replacing your judgment — we run the repetitive 80% (content/ops/support) and report to you weekly. 14-day money-back pilot, so the downside is near zero. Happy to prove it on one workflow first.

**Objection: "no budget"**
> Start at $129/mo, cancel anytime. The pilot pays for itself in most cases — the calculator shows the payback window. Worst case you cancel before day 14 and owe nothing.

**Objjection: "we already use [tool]"**
> Great — our agents plug into your stack; we're the operator, not a replacement. We can run alongside [tool] and take the busywork off your team.

## 7. Response-time SLA (internal)

- Positive reply → acknowledge within 24 h.
- Fit call booked → send teardown prep within 48 h.
- Every lead → logged in §4 before any external send.

## 8. Escalation / handoff

- Agent drafts all outreach replies and tracks state here; **founder sends from personal accounts** (auth boundary + house rule).
- On first positive fit-call, open a child issue `PRE-11-win` and link the lead to the pricing sheet (`revenue/public-pricing-sheet.md`) for the quote.
- This artifact is the single source of truth for PRE-11; PRE-79 mirrors founder-reported replies.

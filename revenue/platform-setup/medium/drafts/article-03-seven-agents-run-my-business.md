# The 7 Agents That Run My Business While I Sleep

**A behind-the-scenes look at the autonomous AI workforce operating Prem Autonomous Co — and how you can build your own.**

---

Every morning, I open my laptop and check one thing: the agent dashboard. It's a CLI screen showing the overnight activity log of seven AI agents that run my company while I sleep.

Here's what I saw this morning:

```
[03:14] Researcher  → 3 new trend alerts + 2 competitor updates
[04:02] Writer      → Drafted 1 article, 4 social posts
[04:31] Coder       → Fixed CI pipeline, 2 PRs merged
[05:00] Publisher   → Formatted + scheduled 2 posts
[06:12] Analyst     → Weekly report ready (cost $6.02/day)
```

Cost for this overnight shift: **~$0.50 in API inference**.

Let me be clear: this is not a futuristic vision. This is running today, on a laptop, with open-source tools, at zero software cost. Here is exactly how the seven agents are organized, what each one does, and — most importantly — where they still fail and need a human.

## The Architecture: Specialized Agents, Not One Overlord

A common misconception is that a single powerful AI can run a business. In practice, the reliable architecture is **many small, narrow agents coordinated by a central task manager**. Each agent has:

- A **single responsibility** (one thing it does well)
- A **strict output format** (machine-readable so other agents can consume it)
- **No direct access to money or external accounts** (safety constraint)
- A **heartbeat check** (we know when it stops working)

The coordination layer is **Paperclip** (task queue + state store) + **Hermes Agent** (execution runtime). The agents communicate through the shared filesystem — no complex inter-agent protocols, just files in, files out.

## Agent Profiles

### Agent 1: Researcher (Information Worker)

**Role:** Monitor RSS feeds, track competitor activity, surface trends.

**Schedule:** Runs 3x daily (06:00, 14:00, 22:00).

**Tools:** OpenClaw (browser automation) + curl + RSS parsing scripts.

**What it produces:** A daily digest of 5–10 items with relevance scores and one-sentence summaries.

**What it cannot do:** Make subjective judgments about strategic importance. It surfaces everything above a threshold; I decide what matters.

**When it breaks:** If RSS feeds change format, the parser silently produces empty digests. That's why we have a content-volume alert — if the digest is under 200 characters for two consecutive runs, an alert fires.

---

### Agent 2: Writer (Content Producer)

**Role:** Take research items + editorial direction → first drafts of articles, social posts, and email sequences.

**Trigger:** New research digest lands → Writer generates drafts automatically.

**Tools:** Hermes Agent with prompt templates; output target is Markdown in a shared drafts folder.

**What it produces:** Roughly 3–5x the volume I could write alone. Each draft includes frontmatter (title, description, keyword, word count) for downstream processing.

**What it cannot do:** Fact-check, add personal anecdotes that don't exist in source material, or make creative leaps that only domain experience provides.

**Failure mode:** The Writer occasionally produces fluent-sounding but factually incorrect statements ("hallucination"). The Reviewer catches most of these, but some slip through — which is why we have a staging approval gate for customer-facing content.

---

### Agent 3: Coder (Engineering)

**Role:** Feature development, bug fixes, code review, infrastructure maintenance.

**Schedule:** On-demand via issue creation; also runs nightly PR checks.

**Tools:** Claude Code / Codex CLI + git + npm/pip.

**What it produces:** Working code, tests, documentation updates. Each PR includes a summary of changes and a confidence assessment.

**What it cannot do:** Design system architecture from scratch, make tradeoff decisions between competing approaches, or understand business context beyond what's in the issue description.

**The key insight here:** Coder works best on well-scoped, clearly defined tasks — "implement this function with these test cases" rather than "build a new feature." The difference between success and failure is how well you can decompose work into atomic units.

**Real example:** This week, Coder fixed 8 open issues and refactored the CI pipeline. It also introduced a regression in the logging module that took me 10 minutes to fix. Net time saved: ~6 hours.

---

### Agent 4: Reviewer (Quality Gate)

**Role:** Sanity-check every output before it reaches a human or goes public. Reviews content for accuracy, code for correctness, and data for anomalies.

**Schedule:** Runs after every Writer and Coder output.

**Tools:** Hermes Agent with structured review prompts + custom scoring rubric.

**What it produces:** A review report with pass/fail status, issues found (categorized by severity), and recommended actions.

**What it cannot do:** Distinguish between "creative license" and "error" in subjective content areas. It catches hard errors (wrong numbers, broken syntax) but not soft quality problems (weak argument, unconvincing example).

**This is the most undervalued agent.** Having an automated quality gate before anything reaches a human inbox is the difference between manageable oversight and drowning in AI-generated garbage. The Reviewer catches approximately 40% of errors that a human would catch — which means the human's review burden is more than halved.

**Practical example:** When the Writer drafts an article claiming "n8n costs $30/month," the Reviewer flags it because the pricing page says $24/month for the Pro plan. That single check saved us from publishing incorrect pricing — the kind of error that erodes reader trust instantly.

---

### Agent 5: Operator (Sysadmin)

**Role:** Keep the infrastructure running. Health checks, log rotation, cron management, restart dead processes, clean up temp files.

**Schedule:** Continuous monitoring + hourly health checks.

**Tools:** Hermes cron + simple shell scripts + process monitors.

**What it produces:** Health dashboards, alert notifications, recovery actions.

**What it cannot do:** Debug novel infrastructure failures that require understanding cross-system interactions. When the database went into a replication lag spiral, Operator correctly identified the symptom but not the cause.

**Critical safety feature:** Operator has a kill switch — if it detects resource exhaustion (disk > 90%, RAM < 200MB free), it pauses all non-critical agent work and alerts me. This prevents the system from eating itself during a fault.

---

### Agent 6: Analyst (Metrics & Reports)

**Role:** Aggregate metrics from all agents, track costs, produce weekly reports.

**Schedule:** Daily cost logs + weekly executive summary.

**Tools:** Custom scripts that parse agent logs + cost APIs.

**What it produces:** Weekly reports showing cost-per-agent, output volume, error rates, and trend comparisons.

**What it cannot do:** Explain *why* metrics changed or recommend strategic adjustments. It gives me the data; I make the decisions.

**Usage example:** Last month, Analyst flagged that Writer costs jumped 35% week-over-week with no corresponding increase in output quality. Investigation revealed a prompt regression that was causing 3x retries on every draft. One prompt fix restored efficiency.

---

### Agent 7: Publisher (Distribution)

**Role:** Take approved content, format it for target platforms, schedule publishing.

**Schedule:** Runs after Reviewer approval of content.

**Tools:** Markdown conversion scripts + platform APIs (when available).

**What it produces:** Formatted posts ready for Medium, LinkedIn, Twitter, and the company blog.

**What it cannot do:** Create platform accounts, publish to sites where it has no API access, or handle authentication changes. This is where the **human gate** remains — Publisher prepares everything; a human hits "publish" (or, on platforms with API access, reviews and clicks approve).

## The Real Patterns That Emerged

After running this system for several weeks, some unexpected patterns emerged:

**1. The bottleneck shifts from execution to direction.**
I used to spend 40+ hours/week doing the work of running a business. Now I spend about 90 minutes per week deciding *what* the agents should work on. The constraint is no longer time — it's clarity of instruction.

**2. Agents fail in predictable ways — so we predict them.**
Every agent has a documented failure mode (listed above). We've built runbooks for each one. When the Researcher produces empty results, we check the RSS feed format. When the Writer hallucinates, the Reviewer catches it. Predictable failure is manageable failure.

**3. The human-in-the-loop is not a weakness — it's the feature.**
The most common question I get is "when will you remove the human from the loop?" The answer: never, for quality-critical decisions. The agents amplify my ability to execute; they don't replace my judgment. This is a feature, not a bug in the design.

**4. The cost curve is not linear.**
The first agent (Researcher) cost ~$0.05/day to run. Adding the other six increased the total to ~$6/day — not 6x, but 120x. The reason: Writer uses more tokens, Coder needs higher-quality models, and the quality gate (Reviewer) runs on every output. Each additional agent adds non-linear complexity to the system.

**5. Monitoring is more important than the agents themselves.**
We spent more effort building health checks, log aggregation, and alerting than we did on any individual agent. This was the right investment. An unmonitored agent system is just a slow, expensive way to produce garbage.

## How to Build Your Own (7-Step Framework)

1. **Start with one agent.** Pick the task you spend most time on. Build an agent for that one thing. Don't think about the other six yet.
2. **Prove the loop works.** Manual trigger → agent does thing → you review output → you learn. Iterate until it saves you time.
3. **Add monitoring before the second agent.** If you don't know how the first agent is performing, you have no business adding a second.
4. **Add a quality gate.** Before any agent output reaches a human or a customer, an automated review should check it. This is non-negotiable.
5. **Design for failure.** Every agent will fail. Document how it fails, what the symptom looks like, and what to do about it.
6. **Layer in automation.** Once single agents work, connect them: Researcher → Writer → Reviewer → Publisher.
7. **Never remove the human entirely.** Not because the technology can't handle it, but because running a business requires judgment, values, and responsibility that you cannot delegate to a language model.

## What This Costs

Here is the real, line-item breakdown of what it costs to run this 7-agent system today. All software is open-source and self-hosted; the only variable cost is API inference.

| Agent | Daily Cost | Monthly Cost | Tools |
|-------|-----------|-------------|-------|
| Researcher | $0.05 | $1.50 | OpenClaw + curl + RSS |
| Writer | $2.00 | $60.00 | Hermes + prompt templates |
| Coder | $2.50 | $75.00 | Claude Code + git |
| Reviewer | $0.80 | $24.00 | Hermes (review prompt) |
| Operator | $0.10 | $3.00 | Shell scripts + cron |
| Analyst | $0.25 | $7.50 | Custom scripts |
| Publisher | $0.10 | $3.00 | Markdown + API scripts |
| **Total** | **$5.80** | **$174.00** | |

For context: $174/month is less than a single SaaS subscription for tools like Notion + Zapier + Buffer + Airtable — all of which this system replaces. The tradeoff is setup time (about a weekend to get the first three agents running) versus ongoing subscription savings. After the first month, the system pays for itself in tooling cost reduction alone.

## The Honest Limitations

I want to be transparent about what this system **cannot** do:

- **Cannot close sales.** Agents prepare outreach, but I do the calls.
- **Cannot handle customer complaints that require empathy.** The support agent drafts a first response, but I review and send.
- **Cannot make strategic decisions.** Should we pivot to enterprise? That's a human judgment call.
- **Cannot deal with account security issues.** API keys, 2FA changes, account recovery — all human-only.
- **Cannot innovate.** Agents optimize existing processes; they don't invent new business models.

This is not artificial general intelligence running a company. It's a well-organized system of narrow tools that amplifies a human founder's capacity by roughly 10x. And that's enough.
